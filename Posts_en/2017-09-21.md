Collecting love from all over the world   
I'll leave it there   
I'm waiting for your visit   
   
The earth is too vast   
Because I might not find you   
I'll pave the path with love   
Hoping you pass by   
   
The night is too dark   
Because you might not see   
Love as a candle   
I'll light up both sides of the path   
   
When the candle burns out   
I wonder if you haven't come yet   
So make love into a balloon   
Fly it high, so high   
To the End of the Sky   
   
If you still can't find it   
Scattered on the Earth   
Scattered in the dark night   
I'll spread love all over the world
